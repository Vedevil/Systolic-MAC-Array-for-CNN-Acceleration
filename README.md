# Systolic-MAC-Array-for-CNN-Acceleration
This repository contains the complete RTL-to-GDSII flow for implementing a systolic array architecture using the SkyWater SKY130 open-source PDK and OpenLane. The project demonstrates the digital ASIC design flow from synthesis to layout, targeting a custom matrix multiplication accelerator core.
